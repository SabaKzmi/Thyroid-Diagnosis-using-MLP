# Thyroid Diagnosis using Multi-Layer Perceptron
Using given data to determine whether the thyroid is underactive, overactive, or functioning normally, utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network. The training function adjusts weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs, improving the model's accuracy over time.

## Multi-Layer Perceptron
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. It learns complex patterns through backpropagation. 
### Features
- **Activation Function:** Uses sigmoid functions for neuron activation
- **Training Stop Condition:** The training process stops when the validation accuracy reaches 90% or the validation performance does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs.
- **Model Accuracy:** Achieves an accuracy of around 94% on the test dataset.
